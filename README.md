## Project Summary
Patients at local doctors' offices often face long hold times when scheduling appointments over the phone. This results in frustration, abandoned calls, and additional stress for clinic staff.  

Our solution: **My Health Assistant**, an **AI-powered chatbot** designed to automate and streamline medical appointment scheduling.  

The chatbot will allow patients to:
- Select their provider, appointment slot, and location
- Receive appointment confirmations and reminders
- Schedule appointments 24/7 without waiting on hold
- Integrate with existing scheduling software for real-time availability

## Problem Statement
- Patients face **long wait times** when scheduling via phone.  
- Many calls are abandoned or redirected to other providers.  
- Clinic staff are overwhelmed, resulting in **decreased productivity and poor service quality**.  
- A 2024 Accenture study found that AI-based scheduling reduced wait times by **80%**, improved schedule utilization by **33%**, and lowered administrative overhead by **40%**:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  

---

## Solution
Our chatbot integrates with clinic scheduling systems to provide:
- **Natural language scheduling** via an AI-powered interface  
- **Provider, time slot, and location selection**  
- **Real-time confirmation/reminder system** to reduce no-shows  
- **Admin dashboard** for monitoring schedules  

By reducing manual workload, clinics can improve **staff efficiency** and **patient satisfaction**.
